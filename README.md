## Description
This repository contains a Risk Calculator App built using Python and PyQt5. The application aims to provide insights into credit risk prediction for Eurozone banks based on climate change data and Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) recommendations.

## Features
- Load data from CSV files
- Select a country and year to generate a report
- Calculate credit risk predictions using both deep learning models and Bayesian models
- Display historical data
- Visualize the causal structure model using NetworkX

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- PyQt5
- Pandas
- NumPy
- TensorFlow
- PyMC3
- Scikit-learn
- CausalNex
- Matplotlib
- NetworkX
- SQLite3
